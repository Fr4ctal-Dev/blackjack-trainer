###### This is a BlackJack trainer. It trains the user on how to count cards using the High/Low or Revere(Plus/Minus) method of counting

###### This is not designed for use at a Vegas table, but rather to prepare your mind before going to a table.

Revisited code and tried to condense. Still working on it. Fixed most major breaks, but will need to clean that up a bit too with Exception handlers.

Latest code condensation was borrowed from @DavidEGrayson (thank you, sir)

1. Single, Double, and Six deck trials
	-> Counts work with single, double, and six deck selections, but...
	-> Selection breaks after first round of play. Will debug soon.
	-> Last debug did not break, but want to retest.
2. Running and true count calculations
3. Function for Hit/Stand/Double Down/Insurance/Split
4. Basic Strategy Suggestions
